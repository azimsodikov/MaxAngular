  /*So in order to test LoginComponent we would need to know the inner workings of AuthService.
  Thatâ€™s not very isolated but also not too much to ask for in this scenario. 
  However imagine if LoginComponent required a number of other dependencies in order to run, 
  we would need to know the inner workings of a number of other classes just to test our LoginComponent.
  This results in Tight Coupling and our tests being very Brittle, i.e. likely to break easily.
  For example if the AuthService changed how it stored the token, 
  from localStorage to cookies then the LoginComponent test would break since it would still be setting the token via localStorage. 
  This is why we need to test classes in isolation, we just want to worry about LoginComponent and not about the myriad of other things LoginComponent depends on.
  We achieve this by Mocking our dependencies. Mocking is the act of creating something that looks like the dependency 
  but is something we control in our test. There are a few methods we can use to create mocks.*/
